# mk-powershell
My personal configuration and customization for PowerShell.
Please note that this is based on [ChrisTitusTech Powershell](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/powershell-profile/) profile.
It has been modified by me for my personal usage and liking.

The main change it's the prompt preference, changing it from Oh-My-Posh to Starship for better performance and shorter loading times.
Unused fuctions have been removed.

## One Command Install (Admin PowerShell Recommended)

Execute the following command in an elevated PowerShell window to install the PowerShell profile:

```
irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Markov-Komarov/mk-powershell/main/setup.ps1" | iex
```

## Fix the Missing Font

Since the script installs the NerdFont you'll just need to change the font settings on the Terminal app or Powershell (Whichever you're using).

Enjoy a minimalistic looking and enhanced Powershell experience!
